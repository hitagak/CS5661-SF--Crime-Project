# CS5661-SF-Crime-Project

- Project description (1 paragraph)
This project is to develop an analytical model which predicts the category of the crime incident which Happened in San Francisco between 2003 to 2015.


There are over 800,000 datasets, but it is hard to calculate, so we choose 35,000 data randomly. Each dataset has 6 features (Dates of the incident, Day Of the Week, PdDistrict, address, Longitude (X), Latitude(Y), and 1 label (Category). 


Our goal is to get a percentage of accuracy by using various classification like ada boost, logistic regression, ANN, random forest, etc. This is the project link. ( https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime )

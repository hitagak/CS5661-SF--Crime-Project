# CS5661-SF-Crime-Project

### Project title
San Francisco Crime Classification 


### Project description
This project is to develop an analytical model which predicts the category of the crime incident which Happened in San Francisco between 2003 to 2015.

We randomly choose 35,000 data from 878,049 datasets. Each datasets has 6 features (Dates of the incident, Day Of the Week, PdDistrict (name of the Police Department District), address, Longitude (X), Latitude(Y), and 1 label (Category).

Our goal is to get an accuracy of predicting label by using various classification like SVM, ANN, ada boost which we study in CS5661. In addition, we also try logistic regression, random forest, etc.
